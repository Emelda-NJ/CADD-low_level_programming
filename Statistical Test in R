Statistical methods are fundamental in bioinformatics for analyzing biological data, identifying patterns, and making inferences.

Statistical Test
Statistical tests are used to determine if there is a significant difference between groups or conditions. Common tests include:
t-test, ANOVA, Chi-square, z-test

t-test
The t-test assesses whether the means of two groups are statistically different from each other.
# Sample data
control_1 <- c(5.2, 4.8, 5.0, 5.5, 5.4)
treated <- c(5.4, 3.8, 4.5, 5.5, 5.4)
# Perform t-test
t.test(control_1, treated)

# Generate sample data for group 1 and group 2
group_1 <- rnorm(30, mean = 5, sd = 2)
group_2 <- rnorm(30, mean = 6, sd = 2)
# Perform t-test to compare the means of group 1 and group 2
t.test(group_1, group_2)

# NOTE: rnorm(30, mean = 5, sd = 2): Generates 30 random numbers from a normal distribution with a mean of 5 and a standard deviation of 2.
        t.test(group_1, group_2): Performs a t-test to compare the means of group_1 and group_2

ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)
ANOVA is used to compare means across three or more groups.
# Generate sample data
group_1 <- rnorm(30, mean = 5, sd = 2)
group_2 <- rnorm(30, mean = 6, sd = 2)
group_3 <- rnorm(30, mean = 7, sd = 2)

# Combine data into a data frame
data <- data.frame(
  values = c(group_1, group_2, group_3),
  group = factor(rep(1:3, each = 30))
)

# Perform ANOVA to compare the means of the groups
anova_result <- aov(values ~ group, data = data)
summary(anova_result)
# NOTE: aov(values ~ group, data = data): Performs ANOVA to compare the means of the groups.

Chi-square Test
The Chi-square test is used to determine if there is a significant association between categorical variables.
# Observed frequency matrix
observed <- matrix(c(10, 20, 30, 40), nrow = 2)

# Perform Chi-square test
chisq.test(observed)
# NOTE: matrix(c(10, 20, 30, 40), nrow = 2): Creates a 2x2 matrix of observed frequencies.
        chisq.test(observed): Performs a Chi-square test on the observed frequency matrix.

z-test
The z-test is used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups when the population variances are known and the sample size is large.
install.packages("BSDA")
library(BSDA)

# Generate sample data
group_1 <- rnorm(30, mean = 5, sd = 2)
group_2 <- rnorm(30, mean = 6, sd = 2)

# Perform z-test to compare the means of group 1 and group 2
z.test(group_1, group_2, sigma.x = 2, sigma.y = 2)

# GENERAL NOTES:
Statistical significance is a determination made by a hypothesis test that an observed effect in a dataset is unlikely to have occurred due to chance alone. 
It is often used to reject or fail to reject a null hypothesis based on the data collected.

Null Hypothesis (H₀): The null hypothesis is a statement that there is no effect, no difference, or no relationship between variables. 
It serves as a default or baseline assumption that any observed pattern is due to random chance rather than a real effect.

Observed Pattern: This refers to the actual data or results obtained from an experiment or study. 
For example, this could be the difference in means between two groups, the correlation between two variables, or the proportion of successes in a sample.

P-Value: The p-value quantifies the probability of obtaining the observed results, or something more extreme, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. 
It helps determine whether the observed pattern is likely to have occurred by chance. It is a measure used to determine the strength of the evidence against the null hypothesis.

The standard p-value threshold, often used in many fields, is 0.05. This means that if the p-value is less than 0.05, the results are considered statistically significant.
Significance Level (α): The threshold at which you reject the null hypothesis. Common significance levels are 0.05, 0.01, and 0.10.

Decision Based on P-Value and Significance Level
P-Value < Significance Level (α): If the p-value is less than the chosen significance level (commonly 0.05), it indicates that the probability of observing such a pattern purely by chance is very low. 
This provides strong evidence against the null hypothesis, leading to its rejection. In other words, it suggests that the observed pattern is unlikely to be due to random chance, implying a statistically significant effect or difference.

P-Value ≥ Significance Level (α): If the p-value is greater than or equal to the significance level, it indicates that the observed pattern could reasonably occur by chance. 
This means there isn't enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis, so we fail to reject it. This doesn't prove that the null hypothesis is true; it simply suggests that the data do not provide strong enough evidence against it.

Hypothesis Testing and Significance Levels
Null Hypothesis (H₀): The default position that there is no effect or no difference. It is the hypothesis that a researcher tries to disprove or reject.
Alternative Hypothesis (H₁ or Ha): The hypothesis that there is an effect or a difference. It is what the researcher wants to prove.

Example to Illustrate
Imagine you are testing a new drug to see if it lowers blood pressure more effectively than a placebo. 
The null hypothesis (H₀) states that the drug has no effect on blood pressure (i.e., any observed difference is due to random chance).

Conducting the Experiment: You administer the drug to one group and a placebo to another group.
Observing the Results: You observe a difference in blood pressure reduction between the two groups.
Calculating the P-Value: Statistical analysis yields a p-value of 0.02.
Since the p-value (0.02) is less than the significance level (0.05), you reject the null hypothesis. 
This means you have sufficient evidence to conclude that the drug has a statistically significant effect on lowering blood pressure, beyond what would be expected by random chance.
